# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is the final capstone for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. It analyzes ride data for a fictional bike-share company, **Cyclistic**, to uncover insights into how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Business Task
The marketing team at Cyclistic wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. Insights from this analysis will inform a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Data Source
The data used in this project comes from Cyclisticâ€™s public historical trip data, specifically for:

- **2019 Q1** and **Q2** (or your actual quarters used)

>  *Data has been cleaned and aggregated in accordance with Cyclistic's data use policy. Personal information has been removed for privacy.*

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **R / RStudio** â€“ for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
- **Excel** â€“ for initial data inspection and cleaning
- **PowerPoint** â€“ for communicating findings
- **GitHub** â€“ for version control and portfolio presentation
