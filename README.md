# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is the final capstone for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. It analyzes ride data for a fictional bike-share company, **Cyclistic**, to uncover insights into how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members.
